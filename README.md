## Running the game

### From source 

This requires: 
- having [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed on your machine
- having a Google Gemini API key, you can generate one for free by following
[these instructions](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/go_quickstart#set-up-api-key)

Prepare your environment by running the following command: 

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
And then open the `.env` file and put your Gemini API key in it. 

Finally, execute the following command: 

```bash
go run main.go
```

## How does this work ? 

The game starts off by proposing a list of starting words that you can combine
with each other to create new words or expressions. 

Each time you request 2 expressions to be combined, the app will request Gemini to 
combine them using a predefined prompt. 

The game keeps track of the list of discovered expressions allowing players to 
progressivly discover new ones. Possible expressions are virtually unlimited 
since it's being generated by an LLM. 

## Roadmap 

- [ ] Keep the history of discovered expressions after exit
- [ ] Prompt user for a Gemini API key if none is found 
- [ ] Cache expression combination results
- [ ] Throttle combination requests to avoid hitting Gemini API rate limit 
- [ ] Improve TUI experience (currently blocking sequential execution)
- [ ] Improve game flow (currently impossible to deselect a word)
- [ ] Better handling of the Gemini API response errors
